#ShinyPop
##Visualisations of matrix projection models using R

**ShinyPop** is a webapp that uses RShiny and the `R` packages 
[`popdemo`](https://github.com/iainmstott/popdemo) and 
[`Rage`](https://github.com/jonesor/Rage)
to visualise population dynamics and life history parameters using 
matrix projection models (MPMs). MPMs may be specified by the user, 
otherwise **ShinyPop** connects to the 
[COMPADRE and COMADRE MPM databases](htps://www.compadre-db.org), 
which provide over 9000 MPMs for more than 1000 species of plants and 
animals.  

The app is available at 
[iainmstott.shinyapps.io/ShinyPop](https://iainmstott.shinyapps.io/ShinyPop)
